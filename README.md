# CpuOptMonitor

CpuOptMonitor integrates an adaptive runtime optimization system to wrap the entire CPU in a feedback-driven optimization framework. This system dynamically applies sophisticated algorithms for tensor algebra, sparse matrix operations, and high-dimensional data handling, adapting in real-time to maximize compute-to-memory efficiency on general-purpose CPUs.
